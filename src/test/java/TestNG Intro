CÃ©dric Beust is the developer of the TestNG framework.

These many days we are writing our test cases or test logics inside a main method(). We can have at max one main method per class
If we want to develop 1000 test cases, then we need 1000 files.

Prior to TESTNG, the only testing framework in JAVA was JUNIT.

Purpose of JUNIT was to do a unit testing of the code, but it cannot be used for an end to end testing

TESTNG is a testing framework inspired from JUNIT and NUnit (C#), but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use

TESTNG is applicable for JAVA only and it can be used in Selenium, Playwright and Rest Assured
